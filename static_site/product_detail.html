          <h3>Agawi Launch Partner Spotlight: The team behind Daedalic Entertainment</h3>

          <p>Q:What inspired Deponia?</p>

          <p>A: Christina Kaiser: Our creative master-mind Poki aka Jan Müller-Michaelis is the inventor of the whole Deponia story. Sometimes everyone here at Daedalic is confused about all his creative and somehow weird ideas :-) Poki, as a great storyteller, also told us how he got the idea for Deponia: When he tried to come up with a setting about a world that’s never been a basis for an adventure game, a trash planet came to his mind. Once he remembered that in his childhood, he tried to build forts out of trash. So the planet reminded him of a huge adventure playground, a world assembled bit by bit to a giant scrap heap. The main idea of the game is to explore what it is like to be restless and to permanently live in improvised conditions Rufus as a character is kind of a part of Poki himself, of course in a very exaggerated way!</p>
           
          <p>Q: Why do you think Deponia has caught on and become a hit?</p>

          <p>A: Christina Kaiser: Deponia is an outstanding game with special storytelling. The main character Rufus is far away from being the perfect son-in-law with his egocentric point of view. His chaotic, ruthless behavior makes him an anti-hero. From the very beginning his inventor “Poki aka Jan Müller-Michaelis” never intended to create a character loved by everyone. So Rufus and his adventures still polarize the community. Through the combination of the special Daedalic humor and the extraordinary in-game location, Deponia found its niche of success. Our upcoming adventure “Goodbye Deponia” (release:  fall 2013) will feature a huge story twist and Rufus has to figure out how to deal with a serious setback.  </p>

          <p>Q: Why are you interested in taking your games to tablets? </p>

          <p>A: Tom Kersten: We have gathered a very vivid and large community around our game brands like Deponia, Edna & Harvey, or The Whispered World on the PC & Mac. Now we are looking to expand our audience to reach players on other platforms as well. Our games are not specific to the PC & Mac users, they have the potential to be played and enjoyed by customers on tablets as well. We want to exhaust all the possibilities – and with the help from Agawi we are now able to reach out to all those users that have been locked out from the experience so far. </p>

          <p>Q: Are you continuing to build games for PC?</p>

          <p>Tom Kersten: Yes, absolutely! Our business has always been driven by the PC platform, this is where our roots are and it will continue to be our primary development platform. But at the same time we will be working to make our games available for as many players on as many different platforms as possible. This means not only tablets but includes consoles and Linux as well.</p>

          <p>Q:What made you pick the Agawi service?</p>

          <p>A: Sergei Klimov: One of the strategic goals for Daedalic in 2013 is to strengthen our position in the North American market, and we felt that a partnership with Agawi is a great way to move forward: we’d like to be a part of the future success and we’re very excited about the opportunity to work on Agawi’s platform with the full freedom to determine the rental and price models on our own.

          <p>Q:Tell us about Daedalic Entertainment and what kind of games you make. </p>

          <p>A: Christina Kaiser: Daedalic Entertainment is a Hamburg-based indie-studio that develops and publishes high-quality games worldwide, focusing on projects with strong narratives. Over the last few years, Daedalic has collected 17 German Game Developer Awards (incl. “Studio of the Year 2009”), four German Computer Game Awards (incl. “Best Game 2011”), and more. Our internal development team designs and produces entertainment products. Most of them are very unique Adventure games with originally drawn animations. </p>
